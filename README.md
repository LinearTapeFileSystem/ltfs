# Linear Tape File System (LTFS)

Linear Tape File System (LTFS) is a filesystem to mount a LTFS formatted tape in a tape drive. Once LTFS mounts a LTFS formatted tape as filesystem, user can access to the tape via filesystem API.

Objective of this project is being the reference implementation of the LTFS format Specifications in SNIA (https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/ltfs).

At this time, the LTFS format specifications 2.4 is the target. The LTFS format specification 2.4 is now under public review (https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/publicreview#ltfs).

`./configure --help` shows various options for build and install.

#### Build and install on OSX (macOS)

Before build on OSX (macOS), some include path adjustment is required.

```
brew link --force icu4c
brew link --force libxml2
```

On OSX (macOS), snmp cannot be supported. Need to disable it on configure script.
